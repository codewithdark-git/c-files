### Classes and Objects in C++

#### Classes:
- **Definition**: In C++, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (data members) and behaviors (member functions) of objects.
- **Syntax**:
  ```cpp
  class ClassName {
      // Data members
      // Member functions
  };
  ```

#### Objects:
- **Definition**: An object is an instance of a class. It encapsulates data for the class and provides methods to operate on that data.
- **Syntax**:
  ```cpp
  ClassName objectName; // Creating an object of the class ClassName
  ```
