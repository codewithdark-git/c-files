### Explanation of the Code:

#### 1. Declaration and Initialization of the 2D Array:
```cpp
const int rows = 3;
const int cols = 3;
int myArray[rows][cols];
```
- Two constants `rows` and `cols` are defined to represent the number of rows and columns in the 2D array.
- An integer 2D array `myArray` with `rows` rows and `cols` columns is declared.

#### 2. Inputting Elements into the 2D Array:
```cpp
cout << "Enter " << (rows * cols) << " elements of the 2D array:" << endl;
for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {
        cout << "Enter element at position [" << i << "][" << j << "]: ";
        cin >> myArray[i][j];
    }
}
```
- The program prompts the user to enter elements for the 2D array, calculating the total number of elements as `rows * cols`.
- Nested loops are used to traverse each position of the 2D array.
- For each position, the user is prompted to enter the element, and the input is stored in the corresponding position of the array.

#### 3. Printing the Elements in Matrix Form:
```cpp
cout << "Elements of the 2D array in matrix form:" << endl;
for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {
        cout << myArray[i][j] << "\t";
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```
- The program prints the elements of the 2D array in matrix form.
- Nested loops are used to traverse each row and column of the array.
- Each element is printed, separated by a tab (`\t`), and a new line (`endl`) is used to move to the next row.

# 2D Array Input and Display

This C++ program prompts the user to enter elements of a 3x3 2D array, then displays the elements in matrix form.

## Instructions:

1. Compile and run the program.
2. Enter 9 elements for the 2D array when prompted.
3. After entering all elements, the program will display the elements in matrix form.

Enjoy!
