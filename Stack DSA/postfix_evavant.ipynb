    "\n",
    "When dealing with mathematical expressions, there are three common notations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Infix Notation**: The operator is written between the operands (e.g., `A + B`).\n",
    "2. **Postfix Notation (Reverse Polish Notation)**: The operator is written after the operands (e.g., `A B +`).\n",
    "3. **Prefix Notation (Polish Notation)**: The operator is written before the operands (e.g., `+ A B`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Let’s take a simple expression `A + B * C` to understand the different notations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Infix**: `A + (B * C)`\n",
    "- **Postfix**: `A B C * +`\n",

    "#### 1. **Infix to Postfix Conversion Algorithm**\n",
    "In this algorithm, we use a stack to hold operators and ensure correct precedence and associativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm**:\n",
    "1. **Input**: An infix expression `E`.\n",
    "2. **Initialize**: Create an empty stack `S` and an empty output list `Postfix`.\n",
    "3. **Scan each character** of the infix expression from left to right:\n",
    "   - **If the character is an operand** (e.g., A, B, C), append it to the output list.\n",
    "   - **If the character is an operator**:\n",
    "     - While the stack is not empty and the precedence of the top of the stack is greater than or equal to the current operator, pop the stack to the output list.\n",
    "     - Push the current operator onto the stack.\n",
    "   - **If the character is an opening parenthesis** `(`, push it onto the stack.\n",
    "   - **If the character is a closing parenthesis** `)`, pop from the stack to the output list until an opening parenthesis is encountered.\n",
    "4. **Pop all remaining operators** from the stack and append them to the output list.\n",
    "5. **Output**: The output list is the postfix expression.\n",

    "#### 2. **Infix to Prefix Conversion Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "The conversion of an infix expression to a prefix expression can be done by reversing the infix expression and applying the same procedure as postfix conversion, with a few modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm**:\n",
    "1. **Input**: An infix expression `E`.\n",
    "2. **Reverse** the infix expression (swap left and right parentheses).\n",
    "3. **Convert the reversed expression** to postfix using the same stack-based algorithm as infix to postfix.\n",
    "4. **Reverse the resulting postfix expression** to get the prefix expression.\n",
    "5. **Output**: The reversed postfix expression is the prefix expression.\n",

    "#### 3. **Postfix Evaluation Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "Postfix expressions are easier to evaluate because they don’t require parentheses to enforce precedence. We use a stack to evaluate the expression.\n",

    "2. **Initialize**: An empty stack `S`.\n",

    "     - Apply the operator to these two elements.\n",
