### Classes and Objects in C++

#### Classes:
- **Definition**: In C++, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (data members) and behaviors (member functions) of objects.
- **Syntax**:
  ```cpp
  class ClassName {
      // Data members
      // Member functions
  };
  ```

#### Objects:
- **Definition**: An object is an instance of a class. It encapsulates data for the class and provides methods to operate on that data.
- **Syntax**:
  ```cpp
  ClassName objectName; // Creating an object of the class ClassName
  ```

### Constructor Overloading

#### Overview:
- **Definition**: Constructor overloading allows a class to have multiple constructors with different parameter lists.
- **Purpose**: It provides flexibility in object creation by allowing different ways to initialize objects.
- **Syntax**:
  ```cpp
  ClassName(parameter_list1) {
      // Constructor body
  }

  ClassName(parameter_list2) {
      // Constructor body
  }
  ```

### Inheritance in C++

#### Overview:
- **Definition**: Inheritance is a mechanism in C++ by which one class (derived class) can inherit properties and behaviors from another class (base class).
- **Syntax**:
  ```cpp
  class DerivedClass : access_specifier BaseClass {
      // Derived class members
  }
  ```

#### Access Specifiers:
- **Public**: Public members of the base class are accessible in the derived class and outside the class.
- **Protected**: Protected members of the base class are accessible in the derived class, but not outside the class.
- **Private**: Private members of the base class are not accessible in the derived class or outside the class.

### Access Specifiers

#### Overview:
- **Definition**: Access specifiers determine the accessibility of class members.
- **Types**:
  - **Public**: Members are accessible from outside the class.
  - **Protected**: Members are accessible within the class and its derived classes.
  - **Private**: Members are only accessible within the class.
