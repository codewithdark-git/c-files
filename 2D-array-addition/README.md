### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Declaration of Arrays**: 
   Two 2D arrays `array1` and `array2` are declared to store elements, along with a `result` array to store the sum of corresponding elements.

2. **Inputting Elements**:
   - The program prompts the user to enter elements for the first and second arrays using nested loops.
   - The user is prompted to enter elements for each position of both arrays.

3. **Addition of Arrays**:
   - Another nested loop iterates over each position of the arrays.
   - It adds the corresponding elements from `array1` and `array2` and stores the result in the `result` array.

4. **Displaying the Result**:
   - Finally, the program prints the resulting array after addition in matrix form.

# 2D Array Addition

This C++ program adds two 3x3 2D arrays and displays the result.

## Instructions:

1. Compile and run the program.
2. Enter elements for the first 3x3 array when prompted.
3. Enter elements for the second 3x3 array when prompted.
4. After entering elements for both arrays, the program will display the result of addition.

Enjoy!
