When you pass an object as an argument to a function in C++, by default, it is passed by reference. This means that changes made to the object within the function will affect the original object outside the function.

- We have a `MyClass` with a member variable `x`, and methods `setValue()` and `getValue()` to set and get the value of `x`, respectively.
- We define a function `modifyObject()` that takes a `MyClass` object and an integer as arguments. Inside this function, we call `setValue()` to modify the value of `x`.
- In the `main()` function, we create a `MyClass` object `obj` with an initial value of `5`.
- We print the value of `x` before and after calling `modifyObject()` with `obj` and a new value `10`.
- However, even though we modify the object `obj` inside `modifyObject()`, the changes are not reflected outside the function. This is because the object is passed by value, and modifications are made to a copy of the original object.

To reflect the changes outside the function, you can pass the object by reference or pointer. This allows modifications made to the object within the function to affect the original object outside the function.
