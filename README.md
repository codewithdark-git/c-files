In C++, when a member function is declared as `const`, it indicates that the function does not modify the state of the object. This is particularly useful for methods that are intended to provide read-only access to the object's data or perform operations that do not alter the object's state.

The `getLength()` and `getWidth()` methods are declared as const because they only retrieve data from the object without modifying it.

The `calculateArea()` method is also declared as const because it performs a calculation based on the object's data but does not modify the object itself.

In the `main()` function, we create a Rectangle object rect with a length of 5 and width of 4.

We then call the const methods `getLength()` and `getWidth()` to retrieve the object's data, and `calculateArea()` to calculate the area.


Declaring methods as const ensures that they can be safely called on const objects, and it also helps in enforcing the immutability of objects when desired.
