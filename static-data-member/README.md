Static data members in C++ are class-level variables that are shared by all instances of the class. They are not tied to any specific object instance but belong to the class itself. This means there is only one instance of a static data member shared across all objects of the class.

In this example:
- We define a class `MyClass` with a static data member `count`.
- Inside the constructor of `MyClass`, we increment `count` whenever a new object is created.
- We access the static data member using the scope resolution operator `::`, i.e., `MyClass::count`.
- In the `main()` function, we create three objects of `MyClass`, which increments the `count` each time.
- Finally, we print the value of `count` using the static member function `getCount()`.

Static data members are useful when you want to maintain data that is shared among all instances of a class, such as counting the total number of objects created from that class. They are also used for constants shared among all instances or to maintain global state within the class.
