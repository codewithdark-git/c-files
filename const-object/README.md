In C++, you can create constant objects using the `const` keyword. A constant object is an object whose state cannot be modified after its creation. This means that the member variables of a constant object cannot be changed once the object is initialized.

We define a class `MyClass` with a member variable x and a constructor to initialize x.

The `getValue()` method is declared as const because it does not modify the object's state.

In the `main()` function, we create a constant object obj1 of type MyClass with an initial value of 5.

Since obj1 is constant, we cannot call non-const member functions on it. Attempting to call `setValue()` on obj1 would result in a compilation error.

We can, however, call the `getValue()` method to retrieve the value of x from obj1.

Constant objects are useful when you want to ensure that an object's state remains unchanged throughout its lifetime, providing guarantees of immutability and safety in your code.
